1.I used Angular 2 to complete the assignment.<br/>
2.Bootstrapped with angular cli such that I get the basic structure.<br/>
3.For front-end I used bootstrap. Could have done a better job but time was a constraint.<br/>
4.Wasn't able to write unit test cases as I ran out of time.<br/>
5.Earlier I have worked on angular 1.5 but I made the app in 2 as I had learnt it recently and thought of this app as an opportunity to grow my skills.<br/>
6. I think I was able to address all the functionality.<br/>
7.Would definitely love to hear the feedback. <br/>

Thanks<br/>
Anoop
