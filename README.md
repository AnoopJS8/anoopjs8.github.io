Github Search App
1.I used Angular 2 to complete the assignment.
2.Bootstrapped with angular cli such that I get the basic structure..
3.For front-end I used bootstrap. Could have done a better job but time was a constraint.
4.Wasn't able to write unit test cases as I ran out of time.
5.Earlier I have worked on angular 1.5 but I made the app in 2 as I had learnt it recently and thought of this app as an opportunity to grow my skills.

Thanks
ANoop
